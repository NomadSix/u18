Cool Game idea from Autumn

- room cleaning sim
- inventory on the side
- have useless stats on the side aswell
- get more stats after cleaning the room
- the game never ends so many rooms the clean
- what is the lore
- fun
- it looks like you are running really fast
- i see a cactus that is bent all weird
- thanks
- you pick up slime that give you poits and we can have many diffrent kinds (colors)
- sell slime at the end of each room diffrent colors diffrent price

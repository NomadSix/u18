Cool Game idea from Autumn

- room cleaning sim
- inventory on the side
- have useless stats on the side aswell
- get more stats after cleaning the room
- the game never ends so many rooms the clean
- what is the lore
- fun
- it looks like you are running really fast
- i see a cactus that is bent all weird
- the player does coke for the first time and picks things up and puts them back down getting distracted
- pet me
- pet me more
- thanks
